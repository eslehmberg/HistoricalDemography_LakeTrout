# Original protocol here: Marcy-Quay, B., Wilson, C. C., Osborne, C. A., & Marsden, J. E. (2023). Optimization of an amplicon sequencing-based microsatellite panel and protocol for stock identification and kinship inference of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush).

## Before beginning ##

1. Complete a HotSHot extraction (see inluded protocol). 
2. Qubit a random set of samples from each plate (6-10). If the concentration is extremely high, these may need to be diluted (amount TBD). For Qubit protocol, see product instructions
3. *Clean your workspace*. This is more important than anything. Use a 20% bleach solution to wipe down all surfaces and tools. Let everything dry before use.
