## Before beginning ##

1. Complete a HotSHot extraction (see inluded protocol). 
2. Qubit a random set of samples from each plate (6-10). If the concentration is extremely high, these may need to be diluted (amount TBD). For Qubit protocol, see product instructions
3. *Clean your workspace before and after you work, always*. This is more important than anything. Use a 20% bleach solution to wipe down all surfaces and tools. Let everything dry before use.

## 1. PCR 1 Conditions 

# Recipe: 10uL volume
5uL Qiagen Multiplex PCR Plus Master Mix
3.5uL DNA
1uL RNAase-free water
0.5uL 2uM primers (pooled in equal amounts)

# Thermocycler settings

|Step         | Temperature (C) | Time (sec)     |
|:-----------:|:---------------------------------|
| Initial Denaturation |   95   | 300 (5 minutes)|
|                 35 cycles                      |
| Denaturation         | 95     | 30             |
| Annealing            | 60     | 90             |
| Extension            | 72     | 90             |
|                 Final Extension                |
| Extension            | 68     | 600 (10 minutes)|

# run the same random samples on the Qubit 
# worth also running some of those samples on a gel if you have time

## 2. PCR 2 Conditions

1.5uL PCR1 product
5.85uL RNAase-free water
0.2 μL 10 mM dNTPs
0.2 μL of 10 μM i5 index adapter
0.2 of 10 μM i7 index adapter
0.05 μL of NEB OneTaq HotStart Polymerase

# Thermocycler settings

|Step         | Temperature (C) | Time (sec)     |
|:-----------:|:---------------------------------|
| Initial Denaturation |   94   | 60 (2 minutes) |
|                 10 cycles                      |
| Denaturation         | 94     | 30             |
| Annealing            | 62     | 60             |

| Extension           | 68     | 500 (5 minutes) |


## 3. Pooling and cleaning

a. Pool all samples in single plates, so that you have the same number of tubes as you have plates.

b. Aliquot 200uL from each pooled sample and use Beckman-Coulter Ampure XP magnetic beads to clean any fragments (0.625x bead:sample ratio for large fragments).

c. Do a second clean for small fragments using 0.85x ratio of bead:sample using the same sample you just cleaned.

d. Use the qubit to quantify each pooled sample.
